The Reactive Herald is a web applitcation made to function as a online news room. Users can browse short snippets of articles for free or can pay for a subscription to see full articles. Journalists can log on to create their articles and attach an image, which is stored on amazon web services. An article is not publically displayed until it is published by a publisher.
